## Features

- **Node.js & npm:** Modern JavaScript development environment.
- **Jest:** Powerful testing framework for unit and integration tests.
- **ESLint:** Pluggable JavaScript linter for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript code.
- **Prettier:** Opinionated code formatter to ensure consistent code style.
- **Husky & lint-staged:** Git hooks to run linting and formatting on staged files before commit.
- **EditorConfig:** Helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.
- **GitHub Actions:** Basic CI/CD workflow for linting, testing, and optional code coverage.
- **Dynamic Setup Script:** Personalizes the project (README, package.json, LICENSE, etc.) for quick starts.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your new project up and running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (v18 or higher recommended) and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your system.

### 2. Running The Setup Script

After cloning this template and before you start coding, run the setup script to personalize your new project. This script will:

- Ask for your project's name, description, author, and other details.
- Set up the `package.json` with your information.
- Create or update the `README.md` based on your inputs.
- Update the `LICENSE` file.
- Configure code coverage if you choose to enable it.

Navigate into your project directory and run:

```bash
npm install # Install project dependencies
node setup.js # Run the setup script to personalize your project
# OR if you added a script in package.json:
# npm run setup
```

Once the script completes, review the changes, especially in `package.json`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`. You can then remove `setup.js` and `README.template.md` if you wish, as they are no longer needed for your project.

### Installation

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Describe how to use your project here. Provide code examples, command-line instructions, or a brief guide on integrating your library/application.

```javascript
// Example usage
import { yourFunction } from './src/index.js';

console.log(yourFunction());
```

---

## Scripts

Commonly used `npm` scripts:

- `npm start`: Start your application (if applicable).
- `npm test`: Run tests using Jest.
- `npm test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode.
- `npm test:coverage`: Run tests and generate code coverage report.
- `npm lint`: Run ESLint to check for code quality issues.
- `npm lint:fix`: Run ESLint and automatically fix fixable issues.
- `npm format`: Run Prettier to format your code.
- `npm prepare`: Sets up Husky git hooks (run automatically after `npm install`).

---

## Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm test:watch
```

To run tests and generate a coverage report:

```bash
npm test:coverage
```

The coverage report will be generated in the `coverage/` directory.

## Linting and Formatting

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is configured to enforce code quality and identify potential issues. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for consistent code formatting.

To manually run linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

To format your code with Prettier:

```bash
npm format
```

These tools are also integrated with [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged/) to run automatically on staged files before each commit, ensuring consistent code quality.
